      "\n",
      "1. **Range Trading**: This involves capitalizing on price fluctuations within established bounds. Traders set upper and lower price levels and trade within this range, buying at the lows and selling at the highs, which is suitable for AAPL's significant price volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Momentum Trading**: This strategy exploits daily price movements, especially following news announcements or significant market events. Traders look for stocks moving significantly in one direction with high volume and enter trades in the direction of the momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Moving Averages & Indicators**: Utilize moving averages and other technical indicators to guide trades. For example, using a short-term moving average crossing above a long-term moving average as a buy signal, and vice versa for sell signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Scalping**: This involves making numerous trades for small profits on minor price changes throughout the day. Scalping requires a disciplined and quick execution strategy to capture these small price movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Gap and Go Strategy**: This strategy involves trading in response to significant pre-market gaps. Traders look for stocks that open significantly higher or lower than the previous day's close and enter trades based on the direction of the gap.\n",
